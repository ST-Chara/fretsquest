# Fret's Quest
This mod is a unofficial short story addon for Outer Wilds. It is designed for players that have already explored the main game, but tries to be unobtrusive to the original narrative.
Note: This is an addon for xen's [New Horizons](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/newhorizons/) mod.

The adventure begins with a new entry in your ship log!

Spoilers:
- Outer Wilds base game spoilers? Yes.
- Echoes of the Eye DLC spoilers? Yes.
- Jammer Lore spoilers? Never.

If you record/stream yourself playing this story, we would love to see it! You can find us on the [Outer Wilds Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/MvbCbBz6Q6). Stop by and chat with us about modding!
