# Fret's Quest: An Outer Wilds Story Mod
This mod is a unofficial short story addon for Outer Wilds. It is designed for players that have already explored the main game, but tries to be unobtrusive to the original narrative. Contains spoilers for the base game and mild spoilers for the Echoes of the Eye DLC. Note: This is an addon for xen's [New Horizons](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/newhorizons/) mod.

The adventure begins with a new entry in your ship log!
