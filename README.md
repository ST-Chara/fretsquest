# Fret's Quest
This mod is a short unofficial story mod for Outer Wilds. It is about one "Attlerock's worth" of content. The adventure begins with a new entry in your ship log!
Note: This is an addon mod for [New Horizons](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/newhorizons/).

Spoilers:
- Outer Wilds base game spoilers? Yes.
- Echoes of the Eye DLC spoilers? No.
- Jammer Lore spoilers? No.

If you record/stream yourself playing this mod, I would love to see it! You can find me on the [Outer Wilds Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/MvbCbBz6Q6). Stop by and chat with us about modding!
