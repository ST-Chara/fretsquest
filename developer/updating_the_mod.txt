My Process to Update the mod



1. Playtest and double-check that all jsons have been reset to their original state.
2. Update the todo_list, manifest, and dev_history files.
3. Push a commit to GitHub, with the description being the patch notes.
4. Double-check the new release on GitHub to make sure it looks correct.
5. Wait for the update on the Mod Manager!
